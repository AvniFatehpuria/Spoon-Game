We will develop a downloadable multiplayer role-playing video game that revolves around spoon theory,
(The idea that people with chronic illness wake up with a limited number of “spoons” or energy and even the most basic tasks use some up). 
Our game creates a life-simulating adventure for players to explore the decisionmaking involved in chronically ill person. 
The extension of multiplayer fulfills an important gap in the current productions related to spoon-theory and chronic illness.
Single-player demonstrations of spoon theory are commonly used both online and in real life workshops alike to convey the challenges for this marginalized group. 
Our game’s extension to multiplayer gives the player more than a demonstration, and allows them to determine what their idea 
of a healthy community can mean for themselves and other players. Our goal is to use the multiplayer mechanic and the complexities of spoon theory to create a thoughtful, 
fun game that will help people with chronic and/or mental illness understand and deal with their illnesses, as well as help create empathy in others.
